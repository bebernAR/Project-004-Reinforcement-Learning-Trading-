# Reinforcemente Learning for Trading
## The project is in 'Project-RL' folder.
This project implements a reinforcement learning-based trading system inspired by the "Reinforcement Learning for Algorithmic Trading with Python" course from Udemy. The system is built to train an intelligent trading agent capable of making buy, sell, or hold decisions using a hybrid environment of real and simulated market data. The project includes a custom OpenAI Gym environment, key financial indicators (e.g., SMA Ratio, MACD, RSI), and a deep reinforcement learning agent designed to optimize trading performance. The code uses libraries such as TensorFlow, Gym, and yFinance for data analysis and model training. This project was developed with the guidance of the aforementioned course and additional parameters were fine-tuned with the help of ChatGPT to align the agent's behavior with financial strategies.
